# go-utils

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jgoguen/go-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jgoguen/go-utils)

This repository provides a series of Golang utility libraries I find useful. See
the README files in each directory for information about that library.

It is a goal of this repository to minimize dependencies on libraries outside
the Golang standard library.
